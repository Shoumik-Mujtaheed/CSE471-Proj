# User Flow System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The hospital management system now has a unified user flow where users register first, then login to access their role-specific dashboards.

## User Flow Steps

### 1. Landing Page (`/`)
- **User Registration** → Takes users to `/register`
- **User Login** → Takes users to `/login` 
- **Admin Access** → Takes admins to `/admin-login`

### 2. User Registration (`/register`)
- Users fill out registration form with:
  - Personal information (name, email, password, phone)
  - Role selection (patient, doctor, staff)
  - Role-specific fields:
    - **Patient**: Blood group
    - **Doctor**: Medical specialty
    - **Staff**: Role type
- After successful registration → **Redirects to `/login`**

### 3. User Login (`/login`)
- Users enter email and password
- System validates credentials
- **Role-based redirection after successful login:**
  - **Patient** → `/patient/dashboard`
  - **Doctor** → `/doctor/dashboard`
  - **Staff** → `/staff/dashboard`

### 4. Role-Specific Dashboards

#### Patient Dashboard (`/patient/dashboard`)
- **Overview Tab**: Summary of appointments, prescriptions, blood group
- **Appointments Tab**: View and manage appointments
- **Prescriptions Tab**: View active prescriptions
- **Profile Tab**: Personal information and settings

#### Doctor Dashboard (`/doctor/dashboard`)
- **Time Slots Tab**: Manage appointment availability
- **Leave Requests Tab**: Submit and view leave requests
- **Patients Tab**: View assigned patients
- **Prescriptions Tab**: Manage patient prescriptions

#### Staff Dashboard (`/staff/dashboard`)
- **Leave Requests Tab**: Submit and view leave requests
- **Profile Tab**: Staff information and settings

#### Admin Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`)
- **Slot Requests Tab**: Approve/reject doctor time slot requests
- **Leave Requests Tab**: Approve/reject leave requests
- **Doctors Tab**: View all doctors
- **Staff Tab**: View all staff members

## Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Components**
- `LandingPage.jsx` - Entry point with registration/login options
- `Registration.jsx` - Unified user registration form
- `Login.jsx` - Unified user login with role-based redirection
- `PatientDashboard.jsx` - Patient-specific dashboard
- `DoctorDashboard.jsx` - Doctor-specific dashboard  
- `StaffDashboard.jsx` - Staff-specific dashboard
- `AdminDashboard.jsx` - Admin management dashboard

### **Routing Structure**
```jsx
// Landing and Authentication
<Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
<Route path="/register" element={<Registration />} />
<Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />

// Role-Specific Dashboards
<Route path="/patient/dashboard" element={<PatientDashboard />} />
<Route path="/doctor/dashboard" element={<DoctorDashboard />} />
<Route path="/staff/dashboard" element={<StaffDashboard />} />
<Route path="/admin/dashboard" element={<AdminDashboard />} />
```

### **Authentication Flow**
1. User registers → Role stored in database
2. User logs in → System retrieves role
3. Role-based redirection to appropriate dashboard
4. Dashboard validates user authentication and role
